      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Jonas. I&amp;rsquo;m working as a researcher in New York City. I moved here after having started a machine-learning based legal tech business  with three friends in London in 2015.
In 2014, I finished my PhD in Computational Biology at Oxford University, where I was supervised by Kevin Foster. After that, I moved to Japan on a JSPS fellowship to work with Hisashi Ohstuki on game-theoretical models of evolution.</description>

      <description>I am here reporting a few observations on recent market movements in the cryptocurrency trade that coincide with highly unusual political events in South Korea. None of what I will write in the following should be understood as a definite explanation of the recent behavior of the cryptocurrency markets. Such an oversimplification would be preposterous. There are many moving parts in this market&amp;mdash;and the development of blockchain technology as a business&amp;mdash;that certainly many of them had stronger roles in the market dynamics than the points presented here.</description>
