      <description>I am here reporting a few observations on recent market movements in the cryptocurrency trade that coincide with highly unusual political events in South Korea. None of what I will write in the following should be understood as a definite explanation of the recent behavior of the cryptocurrency markets. Such an oversimplification would be preposterous. There are many moving parts in this market&amp;mdash;and the development of blockchain technology as a business&amp;mdash;that certainly many of them had stronger roles in the market dynamics than the points presented here.</description>
